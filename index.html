            <h2>Cross-course project: Rainydays</h2>
            <p>Description: This website was made over the course of two semesters, across several courses. I first started it while working on the design course at the very start of my studies. As I have been introduced to new skills, so has the site evolved. The latest addition was adding the products to a wordpress API. Because the API source is made locslly, the produsts does not show up on the site.
