# Portfolio-1

Goal

As a developer, you will have to maintain a level of professionalism. This extends past writing code. We need to document our apps so that other developers can run the code without any issues. We also need to keep a professional-looking portfolio so that others have confidence in us and the work that we do.

Brief

In this assignment, you will be documenting three prior submissions from the first year:

- Your cross-course project
- Semester Project 1
- Project Exam 1

You will be creating a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and then documenting the submissions following a given format.

You will then also be creating a README.md for your own personal GitHub profile.

Lastly, you will be creating a portfolio webpage that lists these 3 projects.

This page must:
List the 3 projects as cards
Each card must have:
the title of the project,
a description,
a screenshot of how the project looks when running,
a link to the GitHub repo and a live site if it is online.

NOTE

For ONLINE students, it is fine if the link is to a private Noroff repo and can’t be accessed by the general public.

For CAMPUS students, do not use any private GitHub classroom links. Use your public GitHub repo links.

Some of these submissions might not be on your personal portfolio at this point in time. This is not an issue at this stage.

Project Exam 1 might still be getting marked. Do not make any changes to your submission other than the README.md as detailed in the Level 1 Process below.

Level 1 Process

Create a README.md in each of the submissions if one doesn’t exist.

Copy the template found here, making sure to populate it with your own information: https://github.com/NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example/blob/main/README.md. Feel free to use any other popular templates on the internet if you prefer the way they’ve done it, however, these templates will need to have multiple sections.

Push the changes when done.

Follow this GitHub guide and create your own GitHub profile README.md: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme. Consider googling “GitHub profiles” for some inspiration. 

Push the changes when done.

Create a personal portfolio webpage that lists the 3 projects as cards. These cards must have a screenshot of the project and a link to the GitHub repo for that project. It is fine if the repo is private on the Noroff account at this point in time. This must be done on a public repo on your personal GitHub account. You are free to use whatever tech stack you’d like. The page must look good and be responsive. Consider using GitHub pages to host it, otherwise, you can use Netlify.

Submit the links to all three projects on GitHub, a link to your personal portfolio on GitHub, and the portfolio webpage that you’ve made.

Getting Started

Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

Clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
Install the dependencies:
npm install
Running

Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

npm run start
Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate CONTRIBUTING.md and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

Contact

This is where you can leave your social links for people to contact you, such as a LinkedIn profile or Twitter link e.g.

My Twitter page

My LinkedIn page

License

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.

Acknowledgments

This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
